Description: Provides a drop-in replacement for 'raster::rasterize'
   that takes 'sf-type' objects, and and is much, much faster. There is support for
   the main options provided by the 'raster' function for the value and function used
   when rasterizing, the background value and options for multi-layer rasters.
