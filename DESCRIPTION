Description: Provides a drop-in replacement for 'raster::rasterize'
   that takes 'sf-type' objects, and is much faster. There is support
   for the main options provided by the 'rasterize' function, including
   setting the field used and background value, and function for 
   aggregating multi-layer rasters.
